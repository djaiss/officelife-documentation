# Recent ships {#recent-ships}

## Overview {#overview}

Teams are there to accomplish something. Nothing is worse than people doing something without telling their peers in the company. This leads to miscommunication, doubt and sometimes suspicion. OfficeLife wants to encourage collaboration and communication throughout the entire company. This is where the Recent ships feature comes into play.

When a team accomplishes something, for instance finalize a big project or ship a great feature, it should tell the entire company about it. We call it `Recent ships`.

Anyone in the team can create an entry in the Recent ships log. When an entry is created, it will be public for the entire company to see and will appear in those places:

* on the team page itself,
* on the main Company tab accessible from the header of the application,
* on the Team tab on the dashboard,
* on the Company tab on the dashboard.

When an entry is associated to specific people, it will also appear on the Employee profile page as well.

## Creating an entry {#creating-an-entry}

Creating a Recent ship entry takes place on the Team page itself. Anyone in the team can create an entry. The entry will be visible by the entire company and can always be edited or deleted anytime.

When creating an entry, you can choose to associate specific people in the team with this entry. If specific people are provided, this entry will also appear on the profile page of each one of these employees. Each employee associated with an entry will also get a notification so he’s aware that he’s been flagged as someone who contributed to something great.

You can associate employees from another team as well if you so desire, as sometimes, people from other teams can contribute to ship features. In that case, the entry will still be associated with the original team.
