# Employee management {#employee-management}

Introduced in OfficeLife 2020.1.

## Overview {#overview}

Employees can be managed in Adminland.

### Deleting an employee {#deleting-an-employee}

Deleting an employee is an important decision. It will immediately destroy everything OfficeLife knows about an employee, and will prevent the employee to log in to this OfficeLife account. Those changes will be effective immediately.
