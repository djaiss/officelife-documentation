# Employee management {#employee-management}

Introduced in OfficeLife 2020.1.

## Overview {#overview}

Employees can be managed in Adminland.

### Locking an employee {#locking-an-employee}

Instead of having to [delete an employee](#deleting-an-employee), you can lock the employee’s account. Locking lets you prevent the employee from logging into his account, but keep track of everything this employee has ever done in OfficeLife.

<div class="rules">
  <h4>Rules</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Only employees with the <a href="/docs/understanding-roles">HR or administrator roles</a> can lock an employee.</li>
    <li>An employee can't lock himself, even with enough permissions (for instance, an administrator can't lock himself).</li>
    <li>Once an employee is locked, he won’t appear in the search results anymore, nor in the list of employees in the application.</li>
    <li>He will still appear in the list of employees inside Adminland.</li>
    <li>All content written by the employee will still be available for everyone to see (worklogs, answers to questions,…).</li>
    <li>The employee’s profile will still be accessible through direct links.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Deleting an employee {#deleting-an-employee}

Deleting an employee is an important decision. It will immediately destroy everything OfficeLife knows about an employee, and will prevent the employee to log in to this OfficeLife account. Those changes will be effective immediately.

There are two ways to delete an employee:

* either by choosing the employee on the list of employees in Adminland,
* or by going through the employee's profile and select the Delete option in the upper right menu.

  </ul>
