# Employee profile {#employee-profile}

## Overview {#overview}

Each employee in an OfficeLife’s account has a profile page that every one in the company can browse. This page presents all the information the company knows about the employee. That being said, some information is actually private or shouldn't be seen by others. This is why a lot of care has been put into making sure the privacy of the employee is taken very seriously.

## Basic set of information {#basic-set-of-information}

An employee has a set of basic information:

* name,
* email address,
* birthdate,
* hiring date,
* Twitter handle,
* Slack handle.

### Employee birthdate {#employee-birthdate}

The birthdate is a private information. No one, except the own employee and employees with either the [HR or the administrator roles](/docs/understanding-roles), can see the complete birthdate. Viewing the complete birthdate means knowing the age of the person, which is a private information.

However, in order to get to know your colleagues, it’s nice to know one’s day and month of birth. This is why when you visit the profile of someone in OfficeLife, you will see the day and month of birth of this person.

  <h4>Rules</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Only the own employee or employees with either the <a href="/docs/understanding-roles">HR or administrator roles</a> can update birthdate information.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Hiring date {#hiring-date}

The hiring date is the date that the employee joined the company (or will join the company, if this date is in the future). Adding or updating this date can’t be done by the employee.

Everyone in the company can see the complete date an employee joined the company.

If this date is set in the future, that means the employee will soon join the company. When this date is in the range from now to next week, and if the employee will be part of a team, he will appear on the team’s dashboard so everyone on the team will know someone new is coming, as shown below.

### Work anniversaries {#work-anniversaries}

It’s interesting to know when a colleague has a work anniversary. It’s a time to celebrate. OfficeLife will warn employees when a work anniversary will occur in the upcoming week. This information is displayed on the team’s dashboard for everyone to see.
