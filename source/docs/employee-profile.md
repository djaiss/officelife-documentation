# Employee profile {#employee-profile}

Introduced in OfficeLife 2020.1.

## Overview {#overview}

Each employee in an OfficeLife’s account has a profile page that every one in the company can browse. This page presents all the information the company knows about the employee. That being said, some information is actually private or shouldn't be seen by others. This is why a lot of care has been put into making sure the privacy of the employee is taken very seriously.

## Basic set of information {#basic-set-of-information}

An employee has a set of basic information:

* name,
* email address,
* birthdate.

## Employee birthdate {#employee-birthdate}

The birthdate is a private information. No one, except the own employee and employees with either the [HR or the administrator roles](/docs/understanding-roles), can see the complete birthdate. Viewing the complete birthdate means knowing the age of the person, which is a private information.

However, in order to get to know your colleagues, it’s nice to know one’s day and month of birth. This is why when you visit the profile of someone in OfficeLife, you will see the day and month of birth of this person.

## Rules {#rules}

* About the birthdate information:
  * No one, except the own employee and employees with either the [HR or the administrator roles](/docs/understanding-roles), can see the complete birthdate. Viewing the complete birthdate means knowing the age of the person, which is a private information. However, for the sake of knowing colleagues, knowing the day and month of birth is a nice to know information. Therefore, for any other person in the company, only the day and the month will be displayed.
  * Only the employee or employees with either the [HR or the administrator roles](/docs/understanding-roles) can update birthdate information.

## Notifications {#notifications}

Here are the [notifications](/docs/notifications) that the Team Lead feature triggers:

* when an employee becomes a team lead, a notification is made for this employee,
* when a team lead is removed from this position in a team, a notification is also created for this employee.
