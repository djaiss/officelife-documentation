# Employee profile {#employee-profile}

Introduced in OfficeLife 2020.1.

## Overview {#overview}

An employee has a set of basic information:
* name,
* email address,
* birthdate.

## Rules {#rules}

* About the birthdate information:
  * No one, except the own employee and employees with either the [HR or the administrator roles](/docs/understanding-roles), can see the complete birthdate. Viewing the complete birthdate means knowing the age of the person, which is a private information. However, for the sake of knowing colleagues, knowing the day and month of birth is a nice to know information. Therefore, for any other person in the company, only the day and the month will be displayed.
  * Only the employee or employees with either the [HR or the administrator roles](/docs/understanding-roles) can update birthdate information.

## Notifications {#notifications}

Here are the [notifications](/docs/notifications) that the Team Lead feature triggers:

* when an employee becomes a team lead, a notification is made for this employee,
* when a team lead is removed from this position in a team, a notification is also created for this employee.
