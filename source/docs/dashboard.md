# Dashboard {#dashboard}

Introduced in OfficeLife 2020.1.

## Overview {#overview}

The dashboard is the central place of OfficeLife. It gives employees of all roles an overview of what they can do and what they should know. More specifically, here is an overview of what people can do:

* As an employee:
  * you can indicate if you work from home,
  * you can tell what youâ€™ve done today,
  * you can tell how you felt today.
* As a team member,
  * you can see

## Rules {#rules}

* About the birthdate information:
  * No one, except the own employee and employees with either the [HR or the administrator roles](/docs/understanding-roles), can see the complete birthdate. Viewing the complete birthdate means knowing the age of the person, which is a private information. However, for the sake of knowing colleagues, knowing the day and month of birth is a nice to know information. Therefore, for any other person in the company, only the day and the month will be displayed.
  * Only the employee or employees with either the [HR or the administrator roles](/docs/understanding-roles) can update birthdate information.

## Notifications {#notifications}

Here are the [notifications](/docs/notifications) that the Team Lead feature triggers:

* when an employee becomes a team lead, a notification is made for this employee,
* when a team lead is removed from this position in a team, a notification is also created for this employee.
