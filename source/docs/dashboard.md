# Dashboard {#dashboard}

Introduced in OfficeLife 2020.1.

## Overview {#overview}

The dashboard is the central place of OfficeLife. It gives an overview to all employees of what they can do and what they should know. More specifically, here is an overview of what users can do:

* As an employee:
  * you can indicate if you work from home,
  * you can tell what youâ€™ve done today,
  * you can tell how you felt today,
  * you can answer questions that let you know more about your colleagues.
* As a team member,
  * you can read who has done what this week,
  * you can see who works from home,
  * you can see who has a birthday today, in the current team.
