# Employees {#employees}

## Overview {#overview}

An Employee is one of the core concepts of OfficeLife. It represents a human who works at a company.

In OfficeLife, an employee is not necessarily linked to a user. It’s really important to understand this. A user can have two different accounts in two different companies, with the same user account. This is because when a user creates an account in OfficeLife, he can actually join an existing company or create a new one.

A user is someone who has access to OfficeLife, and when he’s inside his account, he’s an employee. However, an employee has to be created inside OfficeLife by a user.

## Profile page {#profile-page}

Every Employee, linked to a User or not, has a profile page. This page is public inside the company - meaning everyone in the company can see most of the information on this page (unless those who are not shown by default). All of the data entered by an employee on most screens in OfficeLife appear on the profile page of the employee. Also, every action done on an employee appears on the Employee log.

## Work from home {#work-from-home}

Working from home becomes more and more common nowadays. When working from home in a non-remote company, letting your colleagues know that you are not physically here is really important. OfficeLife facilitates this entire process by giving everyone the right amount of information about who works from home.

### How to indicate that we work from home {#how-to-indicate}

An employee can indicate that he will work from home by checking the checkbox on the Employee dashboard.
