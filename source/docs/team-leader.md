# Team leader {#team-leader}

Introduced in OfficeLife 2020.1.

## Overview {#overview}

A team has the concept of team leads. This information is useful, mainly, to understand the hierarchy of a team, and also to know who to contact when important information needs to be shared. However, there can only be one team leader per team. Perhaps I’ll change this in the future, but it’s not in the plans right now. I think teams thrive on having one boss, and that’s it.

## Rules {#rules}

* Everyone in the company can become a team lead.
* An employee can be a team lead of multiple teams.
* When a team lead is assigned to the team, if that’s not already the case, he will become part of the team.
* However, when a team lead is unassigned, he will remain in the team until he’s manually removed.
* Anyone in the company can see who is the team leader of a team.
* Once an employee becomes a team lead, this information appears on the employee’s profile page.
* Assigning a team lead can be done by employees with either the [HR or the administrator roles](/docs/understanding-roles).

## Notifications {#notifications}

Here are the [notifications](/docs/notifications) that the Team Lead feature triggers:

* when an employee becomes a team lead, a notification is made for this employee,
* when a team lead is removed from this position in a team, a notification is also created for this employee.
