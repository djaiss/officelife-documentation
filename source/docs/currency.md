# Currency {#currency}

## Overview {#overview}

Every company needs to deal with money at some point. Money comes with a currency and at the end of the day, even when companies are big and are all around the world, they have only one headquarter that has one main currency.

This is why OfficeLife lets you define one currency for the entire company.

Currencies in OfficeLife strictly follow the [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) specification, meaning that they are defined by a three letters code. Thus, Euro is `EUR`, US dollars is `USD` and so on.

Current features that use this company's currency:

* [Expenses](/docs/expenses).

## Define the companyâ€™s currency {#define-company-currency}

By default, when you create your OfficeLife account, your account is assigned a default currency automatically: USD, or US dollars. You can change this in Adminland very easily.

Simply go to Adminland section, under general, and indicate which currency is the default in your company.
