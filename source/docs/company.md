# Company information {#company-information}

## Overview {#overview}

Every company has some specific details: name, currency used, timezone.

OfficeLife lets you customize some aspects of your company, without giving too many settings to play with. We believe that settings are basically evil and we should avoid them as much as possible. But some things... well, some things should be configurable.

## Update company’s name {#update-company-name}

Your company’s name is saved when you first create your company’s account. However, you can always change it as much as you want – although we suspect you won’t have to change the name that often.

That being said, updating the name is really easy. Simply click on the Rename button and choose a new name. The name will be instantly changed everywhere in the software and all documents that you can export.
