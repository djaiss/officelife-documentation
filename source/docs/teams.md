# Teams {#teams}

A team is a group of people. This is vague on purpose. It’s up to you to decide whether a team is a department, a separate business entity or a team within another bigger team. Employees can be part of one or more teams. When they are part of a team, employees have access to a new tab on their dashboard to see what’s going on this team.

Teams are public. It’s part of the philosophy of OfficeLife to encourage trust, transparency and collaboration. That means everyone in the company knows who is part of which team, what the team does, and what the people inside this team do.

## Team features {#team-features}

When you create a team in OfficeLife, you'll have access to a wide range of features:
