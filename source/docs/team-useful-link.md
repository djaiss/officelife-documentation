# Team useful links {#team-useful-links}

Introduced in OfficeLife 2020.1.

## Overview {#overview}

A team has a life on its own. There are many online places that are useful to a particular team: a dedicated Slack channel, a mailing list name, a private joke... Because each team is unique, it deserves its own set of links.

A team can have multiple links, called "useful links". Those links are public in the sense that anyone can see them, or click on them (although accessing the content of those links themselves is out of our control â€“ a protected Google Docs for instance, couldn't be accessed without proper access).

## Rules {#rules}

* Anyone on the team, and employees with the [HR or administrator roles](/docs/understanding-roles), can add, edit or remove these links.
* A link has a type. Right now we support only Slack, emails and external urls.
* When creating a link, the label is optional, whereas the URL itself is mandatory. If a label is added, this will be the text that will displayed to the user for the given link. Otherwise, the URl will be displayed instead.
