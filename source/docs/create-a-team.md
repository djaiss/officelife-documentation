# Create and delete a team {#create-a-team}

Adding a team, like adding a new employee in the system, can only be done in [Adminland](/docs/adminland). This is because those two actions are not something that are often do in the application, and therefore can be put in a separate page.

Deleting a team will delete everything we know about the team. First, it will remove all the team members from this team. Note that employees won’t be deleted–only the association with the team will be affected. Then, it will delete all the notes, news, information and data associated with the team. There is no turning back with this decision.

One thing will not be deleted when
