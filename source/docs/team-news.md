# Team news {#team-news}

Introduced in OfficeLife 2020.1.

## Overview {#overview}

Every team can have a dedicated set of news, called Team News. These news appear at two places:
* on the team’s page,
* on the employee’s dashboard page, in the Team tab.

These news serve as a way to inform all team members about important events or information that members should care about.

News are public in the entire company.

## Rules {#rules}

* Everyone in the company can read all the team news.
* By default, only the 3 latest news are displayed on the team page, but there is a link to read all the news on a dedicated page.
* Creating a team news is restricted to team members, and employees with the [HR or administrator roles](/docs/understanding-roles).
* Updating and deleting a news can be done by anyone in the company, regardless of their roles. That will change in the future.
