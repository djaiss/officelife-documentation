# Team description {#team-description}

Introduced in OfficeLife 2020.1.

## Overview {#overview}

Teams have several elements that help different people in the company: description and useful links.

The description, simply put, is all about what the team does. It should be a simple sentence, or can contain interesting facts about the team. Useful links are links that help understand how the team works. They could be a link to a JIRA instance, to a private Slack channel,...

Having those two concepts help different kind of people:

* new team members can quickly have a glance of what the team does and how it operates,
* members from other teams, especially in larger organizations, can understand why the team exists and how it can help them.

## Rules {#rules}

* Can be viewed by anyone in the company.
* Can be edited by any members of the team (regardless of [their roles](/docs/understanding-roles)).
* Can be edited by employees with HR and administrator roles.
* Description can contain up to 65 535 characters and supports [the Markdown format](/docs/markdown).
