# Hardware inventory management {#hardware}

Introduced in OfficeLife 2020.1.

## Overview {#overview}

Every company gives their employees some tools to work. Companies using OfficeLife are probably related to technology somehow, and if that's the case, they have laptops and desktops and mice and keyboards and cables that they give to their employees. Keeping track of who has what, and the company's inventory in general, can quickly become a mess. This is why OfficeLife gives companies an easy and simple way of keeping track of hardware.

## Rules {#rules}

* Everyone in the company can read all the team news.
* By default, only the 3 latest news are displayed on the team page, but there is a link to read all the news on a dedicated page.
* Creating a team news is restricted to team members, and employees with the [HR or administrator roles](/docs/understanding-roles).
* Updating and deleting a news can be done by anyone in the company, regardless of their roles. That will change in the future.
