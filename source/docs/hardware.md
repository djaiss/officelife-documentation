# Hardware inventory management {#hardware}

Introduced in OfficeLife 2020.1.

## Overview {#overview}

Every company gives their employees some tools to work. Companies using OfficeLife are probably related to technology somehow, and if that's the case, they have laptops and desktops and mice and keyboards and cables that they give to their employees. Keeping track of who has what, and the company's inventory in general, can quickly become a mess. This is why OfficeLife gives companies an easy and simple way of keeping track of hardware.

## How to manage hardware {#how-to-manage-hardware}

The management of your hardware is done inside [Adminland](/docs/adminland).

### Create a new item {#create-a-new-item}

To create a new item, you need to specify its name. This is the only information that is required. However, you can also provide another information, labelled as serial number, to help you uniquely identify the object. You don't have to use this field to store the serial number per se, as you can enter whatever you want in it. The goal, really, is to help you identify the object.

Even though you can do it later, you can also associate this item to an employee right away.
