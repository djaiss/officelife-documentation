# Dashboard {#dashboard}

Introduced in OfficeLife 2020.1.

## Overview {#overview}

The dashboard is the first thing you see when you sign in to your account. It contains two tabs at the moment:
* a `Me` tab, that contains all the information about you directly,
* a `Team` tab, that is all about what your team(s) is(are) doing.

The dashboard's main goal is to give all the information an employee or a manager needs to know, and move on quickly.
