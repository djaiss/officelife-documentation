        <h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>

<p>If a company wants to have a complete 360 view of what’s happening inside its walls, it needs to buy and configure a lot of tools. There is a tool for every specific aspect of a company: HR, project management, team management, 1 on 1 management… But there isn't any software that combine all of them together in a simple way.</p>

<p>Not only buying and configuring all those software is a time-consuming process, but it also costs a lot of money - especially for smaller companies with a limited budget. Moreover, most of the SAAS out there have a Let's-call-us-and-talk-for-an-hour-before-you-can-see-what-the-pricing-will-look-like-for-you policy, which most people hate (me included) and that I refuse to follow.</p>

<p>OfficeLife has been created to offer a solution to these problems. Most of the smaller companies need to have a tool to manage their companies from a human perpective - not 30 different tools. I think having a tool that does, say, 70% of the job is better than having 15 specific tools that do 100%.</p>

<p>At any given point, managers and employees want to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do the employees feel,</li>
<li>What is the current structure of the teams, offices, who manages who,…</li>
<li>What people are working on right now,</li>
<li>How can we improve the communication between employees and teams,</li>
<li>Who should take a holiday and how much holidays there are left for everyone,</li>
<li>Who currently work from home</li>
<li>What steps should be done and who is responsible at every stage of the onboarding process.</li>
</ul>

<p>All those answers come from knowing your employees well.</p>

<p>Good luck finding a tool that addresses all those points. Some tools do some part of these, but they are also hard to use, hard to configure and not user friendly.</p>

<p>OfficeLife has been created to know everything about your company. Its main goals are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>give an overview of how employees and managers feel right now,</li>
<li>help managers be more empathetic,</li>
<li>help companies be better at managing people's dreams and ambitions,</li>
<li>help employees better communicate with their employers.</li>
</ul>

<p>OfficeLife aims to be a combination of software like <a href="https://www.bamboohr.com/">BambooHR</a>, <a href="https://officevibe.com/">Officevibe</a>, and <a href="https://monicahq.com">Monica</a> – although offered in a single, easy to use application and at a much more <a href="#pricing">reasonable price</a>.</p>

<p>Below is a comprehensive list of all the features of OfficeLife:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to manage all employees at a Human Resources level,</li>
<li>Ability to manage teams

<ul>
<li>Associate employees to them,</li>
<li>Broadcast news about the team to all team members,</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ability to broadcast company news,</li>
<li>Ability to define holidays and time offs schedules on a yearly basis,</li>
<li>From an employee perspective:

<ul>
<li>Ability to define the name, email and physical address</li>
<li>Ability to define managers and direct reports (the link between employees),</li>
<li>Ability to add daily work logs to inform the team and the company,</li>
<li>Ability to indicate how you feel on any given day,</li>
<li>Ability</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="different">How is OfficeLife different</h2>

<p>First and foremost, OfficeLife is different because it doesn’t try to cover all the use cases or address every problem. It doesn't try to suit everyone. OfficeLife tries very hard to be simple to use and bring a set of features that most companies will find useful, and will avoid having features that are specific to a company. OfficeLife is strongly opinionated.</p>

<p>It gives users and companies complete control over their data. You are not locked in the product, nor will you ever be. All the data, both from a company and a user point of view, can be exported for free at any time (even if you don't have a paid account anymore), in a standard JSON or MySQL format. You can also use the API without any restrictions.</p>

<p>Privacy is more than paramount to me – it’s essential. As a matter of fact, I don't track users and I don't use ads or sell data. We might be the only tool of this kind to have this kind of behavior.</p>

<p>Technically, the software is developed with boring, proven, predictable, easy to maintain technologies that make the tool fast and secure. I want to create a product useful for users and companies, not something that is technically exciting.</p>

<p>In terms of user experience, the software aims to be simple to use with the minimum amount of configuration. The design itself is not a priority and is pretty basic right now. We only focus on having a great user experience.</p>

<p>Finally and this is what differentiates us the most, OfficeLife is completely open source and can be installed on your server if you so desire, for free and without any fees.</p>

<h2 id="pricing">Pricing and open-source</h2>

<p>OfficeLife comes in two flavors: open source and hosted.</p>

<p>The open-source version is the one you will find on GitHub. The code is released with the BSD-3 license, which means you can do whatever you want with it as long as you don't try to make money out of the software yourself. You can download the tool for free, whenever you want, and have complete control over everything. You don't need a product key for this. However, you are responsible for your hosting, maintenance, and upgrade of your instance.</p>

<p>The hosted version, which can be found on https://officelife.io, is the exact same version as the open-source one. As a matter of fact, the code that I deploy in production comes from the repository hosted on Github. I take care of maintaining this instance, of upgrading it and making backups of your data multiple times a day.</p>

<p>While the open-source version is free, the hosted version is supported by subscriptions. You pay a fair amount of money each month, and in exchange, you have access to your own OfficeLife’s account. The price is fixed, USD 100 per month (or USD 1000 per year — a good discount!), no matter the number of employees, users or company size. We don't like those other services that charge a small amount of money per user, like $2 per user – you think it’s cheap, but if your company has 200 employees, you end up with USD 400 to pay each month, which is insane.</p>

<p>Also, we don't have any hidden fees. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time.</p>

<h3 id="isnt-it-too-expensive">Isn’t this price too expensive for my tiny company?</h3>

<p>Perhaps. And I’m sorry about this. However, if the price is too expensive for you, which I completely understand, you can still download the open-source version on Github and install it on your server (on Linode, Digital Ocean or Heroku). It’s cheaper, safer in terms of privacy, and you'll deal with the maintenance yourself 😀</p>

<h3 id="why-not-more-expensive">Why is this not more expensive?</h3>

<p>Well. OfficeLife is my baby and <a href="https://twitter.com/djaiss">I’m the only one</a> working on it. I work as hard as I can on this product, day and night. I don't have employees to pay. I don't have a fancy office. I just need to cover my family's needs. If I can convince 200 companies to pay for this service, I can make a very decent living and live the dream. And it’s enough for me.</p>
